                        and displays their username and score in the top left corner of the game screen. There is also a store section

                        with features such as a brush tool, an eraser tool, a fill tool, and a start over option.
                    </p>

                    <p>This website also takes advantage of DOM manipulation and the HTML Canvas library to save the canvas

                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>A project created for a Hackathon with two other members. The premise of the project is a game
                        in which a man who is commiting tax fruad has a nightmare in which he is chased by former
                        Commissioner of the IRS Charles Rettig. 
                    </p>

                    <p>The main gameplay is in the nightmare sequence in which the controllable character participates
                        in an unless running-style game in which he must avoid obstacles while being chased. When the
                        player is eventually caught, he is forced to fill out a 1040 tax form.
                    </p>

                    <p>This project was my first exposure to the Godot game engine. My role in the project was focused
                        more on the sprite designs and animations as well as the start screen, bedroom, and opening cut-scene.
